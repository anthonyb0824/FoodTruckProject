# FoodTruckProject


### Description
This program allows the user to enter up to 5 food trucks. The user will be prompted to input the name, food type, and rating for each truck. The numeric ID will be auto generated by the constructor. After either entering five trucks or entering quit for the name of a truck the user will enter the menu. The menu will list 4 options and will terminate only when the user enters 4 or exit. if the user picks 1 then it will display all existing food trucks in the order of "name, food type, rating, and truck ID". If the user enter 2, the average rating of all the food trucks will be shown. The user enter3, the highest-rated food truck will be shown.


#### Lessons Learned
.nextLine() is weird after using .nextInt() or .nextDouble().
Creating a class is very useful to model real like objects.
Using string builder is sometimes better then creating multiple strings on the heap for garbage collection.

#### Technologies Used
Creating my own class, using instances of the class to access methods inside of that class. Utilizing Arrays and string builder. Creating  getters and setters, along with .toString() methods.
